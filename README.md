A second game for an internship as an Unity Developer

A 2D demo in the hyper casual genre, a test task. The main mechanics of the game is merge, that is, combining items of the same rank and obtaining an item of a new rank. Made in the setting of archaeological excavations and bones, we combine the bones and get a dinosaur at level 5. When you reach level 5, an object has a cross, when you click on it, the level scale increases. As soon as the scale is filled, the game level will end and the restart button will appear.
